The datasets are for the year 2023.

### Tools
- Python with Jupyter Notebook - Data cleaning
- Tableau - Visualizations

### Exploratory Data Analysis and data cleaning
For the EDA we decided to use Python with Jupyter Notebook using mainly pandas. See the code in the following link:

### Data visualization
For the vizualisation we decided to build a dashboard on Tableau : 

### Conclusions
Through the dashboard we can say:

All products are profitable (min 31.6%), although tea is more profitable than coffee. Sales per 1,000 Ha show great disparities, and enable us to prioritize the states to be strengthened and those to be opened up commercially.
In some states, we are able to achieve turnover of over $150 per 1,000 inhabitants.

We need to strengthen our position in the following states: 
- California / Texas / Florida / NY / Illinois / Ohio
We need to open up the following states: 
- Pennsylvania / Georgia / North Carolina / Michigan / New Jersey / Virginia

The break-even point has not yet been reached. So it's best to concentrate on strengthening our position in certain states where there's still room on the market, and then expand into other regions.
